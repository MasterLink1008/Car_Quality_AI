# Car_Quality_AI
This is a AI I created using KNearestNeighbours, I have already dealt with linear AI models and decided to try KNN.
I studied how it works(the math/algorithms) and what the computer does behind the scenes.
The AI ended up predicting the value of a car with a 93% accuracy using various data such as:
the price, cost of maintenance, safety etc...
